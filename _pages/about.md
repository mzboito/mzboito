Hi! I'm Marcely Zanon Boito, a Research Scientist at NAVER LABS Europe. I work on **self-supervised learning**, **low-resource**, **multilingual**, and **multimodal NLP**.

I received my PhD in Computer Science from the University Grenoble Alpes in 2021, with a thesis titled *"Models and Resources for Attention-based Unsupervised Word Segmentation: An Application to Computational Language Documentation."* Before NAVER LABS, I was a postdoctoral fellow at LIA, University of Avignon.

I also hold two bachelor degreesâ€”in **Computer Science (UFRGS, Brazil)** and **Information Systems Engineering (ENSIMAG, France)**, and a **Master's in Artificial Intelligence and the Web (MoSIG, UGA, France)**.
